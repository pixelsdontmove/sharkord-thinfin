## Credits
Sharkord is made by [Diogo Martino](https://github.com/sharkord/sharkord). This desktop client is just a wrapper made with npm and electron. It is in no way or form endorsed by the Sharkord creator or supported by him.

## What is Thinfin?

> [!NOTE]
> Do not use this. I have to make it clear, I only made this for my friends and me. If you decide to use it, it will be at your own risk. There is a severe lack of compatability and features.

Consider the Thinfin client/wrapper as designed by a fair mix of AI and human hallucinations forced into something that works on Windows. I'm using Electron 29.3.0 to make it work.

## Wanna Try It Out?

If you absolutely want to use it, make sure there is a "server.txt" file with the url to your server next to your Thinfin.exe

## Why?

Freedom and democracy.
